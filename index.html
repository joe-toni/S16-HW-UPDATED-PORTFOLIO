            <p class = "aboutMe hideMe">
               My name is J.A. Faburrieta and am currently working on becoming a web developer.
               Experience with the subject is thin but it has been one of my favorite practices ever
               since college.  Along with progaming I enjoy sculpting and writing in my free time and 
               the hope is that I will be able to combine these passions in a programing format.

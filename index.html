               My name is J.A. Faburrieta and am currently working on becoming a web developer.
               Experience with the subject is thin but it has been one of my favorite practices ever
               since college.  Along with progaming I enjoy sculpting and writing in my free time and 
               the hope is that I will be able to combine these passions in a programing format.

                    <p>This project was a collaborative attempt at creating a site that allowed registered users to submit images to a central hub that would then display them
                        along side others as if the viewer were visiting a gallery or museum, It used images brought in from a museum api to initially populate the 
                        slides of the site. For more information feel free to visit the sites below.
